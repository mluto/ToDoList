# ToDoList

ToDoList is my super test task.

## Usage

At the start of the application we get a list of today's tasks.
We can enter or select a date to see tasks from a different day.

The "Add Task" button allows us to add new tasks to the database.

The "Edit Task" button or double-clicking on a selected task from the list allows you to change the task data.

The "Delete Task" button allows us to delete the selected task from the database.

Clicking the "Completed" checkbox or selecting the appropriate option when editing a task allows us to mark the task status
